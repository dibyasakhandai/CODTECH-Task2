Title: Weather Forecasting Website

Objective: To create a user-friendly weather forecasting website that provides real-time weather information for any city using data from a weather API.

Technologies Used:

   HTML for the structure
   CSS for styling
   JavaScript for functionality and API interaction
   
Comprehensive Documentation:

   1. HTML Structure: The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the website, including the title, input field for city name, search button, and a container to display the 
                      weather information.
   2. CSS Styling:  The CSS file styles the page to be user-friendly and visually appealing. It includes styles for the body, container, search box, and weather information.
   3. JavaScript Functionality:  The JavaScript file handles user interactions and API requests. When the user clicks the search button, it fetches the weather data from the 
                                 OpenWeather API and displays it on the page.
   4. API Integration:  The website uses the OpenWeather API to get real-time weather information. You'll need to sign up for an API key from OpenWeather and replace 
                        your_api_key_here in the JavaScript file with your actual API key.
   5. Error Handling: The JavaScript code includes basic error handling to alert the user if the city is not found or if there is an issue with the API request.
                      By following these steps, you'll create a functional and user-friendly weather forecasting website. You can further enhance it by adding features like
